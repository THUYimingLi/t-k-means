This is the implementation of our paper 't-k-means: A Robust and Stable k-means Variant'[[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07442.pdf), accepted by the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2021. The project is developed based on the MATLAB, created by [Yang Zhang](seednov@outlook.com) and [Yiming Li](http://liyiming.tech/). In this paper, we propose a novel robust and stable $k$-means variant, the $t$-$k$-means, and its fast version based on the understanding of $k$-means, GMM, and TMM.
